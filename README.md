## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEOgYlrLU1esQ/feedshare-shrink_1280/0/1698692781194?e=1702512000&v=beta&t=rylaR-eHYY3Yn7LjeFcXvuCwFG05HEjwaIp2wfH326o)

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a smart trash bin project with advanced features. The project aims to revolutionize waste management by incorporating SMS capabilities and automatic lid opening functionality.‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨‚Å¨
1. SMS Integration: The smart trash bin is equipped with a GSM module that allows it to send SMS notifications to the user's mobile phone. Users will receive real-time updates on the trash bin's status, such as when it is full or needs maintenance.
2.  Automatic Lid Opening: The trash bin utilizes sensors to detect the presence of waste. When someone approaches the bin or throws trash into it, the lid automatically opens, providing a convenient and touchless experience.

3. Smart Monitoring: The project includes a web-based dashboard that enables users to monitor the trash bin's status remotely. The dashboard displays real-time data, such as the fill level, battery status, and historical usage patterns.

4. Energy Efficiency: The smart trash bin is designed to be energy-efficient, utilizing low-power components and optimizing power consumption. This ensures long battery life and reduces the need for frequent recharging.

5. Open-Source: The project is open-source, allowing developers to contribute, modify, and enhance the codebase. By fostering collaboration, we aim to create a community-driven solution that can be adapted to various environments and requirements.
